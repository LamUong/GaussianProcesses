# GaussianProcesses

This is an ongoing research project on using Machine Learning to estimate molecular energy of water molecule's clusters. 

Quantum mechanics calculations of energy are accurate but computational costly. 
Our goal is to employ Gaussian Process to make accurate and efficient predictions of molecular energy.
